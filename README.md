# Cripta Messenger

Peer to peer encrypted & signed messaging via MQTT pub/sub.

With Cripta you can relay secure messages instantly using free (and mostly available) MQTT brokers. The broker is
configurable, to use a different broker edit, rebuild the app and distribute that.

## Features

- Asymmetric Encryption using recipient public key
- Inbox management (list, read, delete & empty)
- Mail groups (TODO)
- Message signing with private key (TODO)

## Tests

No tests in this project. It started as an afternoon hack. Maybe there will never be any tests.
